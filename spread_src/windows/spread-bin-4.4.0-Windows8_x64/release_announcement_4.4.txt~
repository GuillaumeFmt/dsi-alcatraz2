Spread 4.4.0 http://www.spread.org

Spread Concepts LLC is happy to announce the release of a 
new release, 4.4.0, of the Spread toolkit. 

The Spread 4.4 release is an important release that incorporates a new,
accelerated ring protocol.  This protocol is tailored for data center networks 
and can provide 30%-50% higher throughput and 20-35% lower latency in modern 
local area networks.  This version also supports Spread's regular ring protocol.

A new AcceleratedRing parameter has been added to Spread's configuration file.
If this parameter is set to true, then the accelerated ring protocol will be used.  
If it is set to false, then the regular ring protocol will be used.  If it is left 
unspecified, then Spread will try to determine which protocol is likely better for 
your environment.  If your configuration looks like it might be a LAN (i.e. - all 
daemon IPs are in the same /16 network) rather than a WAN, then Spread will use 
the accelerated protocol.  Otherwise, it will use the regular protocol.  All the
daemons in a configuration must use the same ring protocol.  Daemons with different
protocols will refuse to communicate with one another.

A new AcceleratedWindow parameter, with a value between 0 and the value of the 
PersonalWindow parameter, should be specified as a flow control parameter in the 
spread.conf file.  The higher the parameter the more acceleration is expected --
up to a point.  In our testing on 1Gb/s and 10Gb/s networks, raising it above 20
had significant negative side effects and actually lowered throughput.  The 
sample.spread.conf file included in this release has example settings for these 
parameters that enable the Accelerated Ring protocol, as well as a description of 
their functions.

The main new features of this release are:

1) Accelerated Ring protocol to improve both throughput and latency in local area networks.

2) Redesigned message-packing, reducing overhead for small messages.

3) Updated MSVS project files for Windows source builds.

4) Several bugfixes that make Spread less likely to exit under high loss.

5) Expanded and improved logging.

For details check the Readme.txt file. 

This release does not include any API changes, so applications should
be able to be relinked or recompiled with the new Spread library without
changes. 

The Spread toolkit provides a high performance messaging service
that is resilient to faults across local and wide area networks.
Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed applications, 
and provides highly tuned application-level multicast, group communication, 
and point to point support. Spread services range from reliable messaging 
to fully ordered messages with virtual synchrony delivery guarantees, even in case 
of computer failures and network partitions.
